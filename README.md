My initial ZMK configuration for my Lily58 Pro. Not much changes, apart from adjusting the keymap. Will look more into it in the future.


## Flash a new version

1. Make some awesome changes in the code, commit and push.
2. Go to the repo's [Actions tab](https://github.com/jeroenwtf/zmk-lily58-pro/actions) and download the latest firmware (it may take time to be generated).
3. Connect the left half with a good cable and press twice the reset button. It will mount the storage `NICENANO`.
4. Drag and drop the left `.uf2` file. It will show a nasty error but it's fine.
5. Repeat for the right half.
6. LFG ðŸ”¥
